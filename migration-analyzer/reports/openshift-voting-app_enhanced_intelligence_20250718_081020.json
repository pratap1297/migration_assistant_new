There are no indicators of code health issues like frequent fixes or large, complex changes, but the absence of active development makes it difficult to assess ongoing code quality. For migration planning, this inactivity might mean less in-depth knowledge of the current codebase among the team, requiring more effort in understanding and refactoring."
